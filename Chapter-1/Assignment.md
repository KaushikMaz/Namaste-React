## Q:What is an Emmet?
A: Emmet is a web development tool that allows you to write HTML and CSS code quickly and efficiently. It uses a shorthand syntax to help you write code faster and with fewer keystrokes.

With Emmet, you can write complex HTML and CSS code using abbreviations that are expanded into full HTML and CSS code. For example, you can type ul>li*5 and it will be expanded into:

```
<ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

```

## Q: Difference between a Library and Framework?
A: A library and a framework are both collections of code that can be used to simplify the development of software applications, but there are some key differences between them.

A library is a collection of prewritten code that provides specific functions or features for use by developers, while a framework provides a structure and set of rules for developing software applications. Libraries are building blocks that give developers control over the application's structure and control flow, while frameworks dictate the overall architecture and provide a comprehensive set of tools and components. The choice between using a library or a framework depends on the specific needs and requirements of the project.
