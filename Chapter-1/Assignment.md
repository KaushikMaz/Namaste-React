## Q:What is an Emmet?
A: Emmet is a web development tool that allows you to write HTML and CSS code quickly and efficiently. It uses a shorthand syntax to help you write code faster and with fewer keystrokes.

With Emmet, you can write complex HTML and CSS code using abbreviations that are expanded into full HTML and CSS code. For example, you can type ul>li*5 and it will be expanded into:

```<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>```
